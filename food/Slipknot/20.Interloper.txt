Fuck you!

Many have come and gone
Still left out of the guttural swansong
Takin' nothin' but the best in the area
Get me grief, but fucker I'll stare you down
Two, three you're out of there
Maybe it's me, but I'm frantic in a panic
Ain't never had a problem since you stopped coming here
Big man walkin' but bitch, I'm still talkin'
Can't you see it's gotta be this way?

Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason not to fuck you up

Ain't gonna leave and you know I'm never gone fade
Here it comes again - gotta burn again
Time now, throw down, don't dirty me
Right on your ugly ass face because
I ain't not the one who let you in
And I ain't not the one who set you off
But I know damn well when someone's pushin' my buttons
Lemme tell you somethin' - I'll push you back!
"As soon as that camera is off, he gonna fuck that little dog."

Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason not to fuck you up
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (bitch)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (bitch)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (bitch)
Give me any reason not to fuck you up

You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh
