Liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness
I just want to
Liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness

Section off myself
Put a wall up
What the hell have I done
Keep the dog at bay
Survive by saving me!
Values and the game
Not a fuck-up
Not a part of your lie
I am one, I am all, I'm above and beyond!

Stand off of the shit
Back off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget
Your garbage in is garbage out
You don't give a shit
I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
Your garbage in is garbage out

Liberate my madness

Liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness
I just want to
Liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness

I am not ashamed
What is vital isn't always humane
You can break in vain
But you can't break away
Even in my face
Lot of bullshit, not a lotta the truth
I can't see from here
But I can smell your fear

Back off of the shit
Stand off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget
Your garbage in is garbage out
You don't give a shit
I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
Your garbage in is garbage out

Saved
You're such a slave
I don't expect a name
You don't care
I wasn't a witness
I can't be a part of a system such as this

Hard eyes
Glow right
In my darkness again
With the sickness, renegade sisters, blisters
Salivate, litigate, liberate, madness, sadness
Fuck this
How long have I had this?
I don't need this
Outta my business
Insert, engage, betrayed, my God
Fraud
Fraud
Fraud

Liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness
I just want to
Liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness
