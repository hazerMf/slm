Maze
Psychopathic daze
I create this waste
Back away from tangents on the verge of drastic ways
Can't escape this place
I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying

Put me in a homemade cellar
Put me in a hole for shelter
Someone hear me please
All I see is hate
I can hardly breathe
And I can hardly take it

Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out!
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't

Lost
Ran at my own cost
Hearing laughter, scoffed
Learning from the rush
Detached from such and such
Bleak
All around me, weak
Listening, incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging

I am in a buried kennel
I have never felt so final
Someone find me please, losing all reserve
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying

Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out!
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't

You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something in you I despise

Cut me
Show me
Enter
I am willing and able
And never any danger to myself
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain
Or was my tolerance a phase?
Empathy, out of my way

I can't die
I can't die
I can't die
I can't die!

You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something in you I despise
