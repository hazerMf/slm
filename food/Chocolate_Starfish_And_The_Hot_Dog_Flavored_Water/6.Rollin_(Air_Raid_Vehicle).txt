People in the house put them hands in the air
'Cause if you don't care, then we don't care (yeah)
One, two, three times, two to the six
Jonesin' your fix of that Limp Bizkit mix
So where the fuck you at, punk?
Shut the fuck up and back the fuck up while we fuck this track up

Twenty-four-seven, never beggin' for a rain check
Old school soldiers blastin' out the hot shit
That rock shit, puttin' bounce in the mosh pit
