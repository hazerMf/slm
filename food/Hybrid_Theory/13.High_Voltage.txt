You know what I mean
You could put a label on a life
Put a label on a lifestyle

Sometimes...

You know
Put a label on how you wake up every morning
And go to bed at night

Hybrid

I've been digging into crates ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I could start blessing it
Chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double helixes and show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumentalness
And all of you MCs who hate us
So you can try on
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones

I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Akira
I put a kink in the backbones of clones
With microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day
Over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon
Technicolor type A

On highways ride with road rage
Cages of wind
And cages of tin
That bounce all around
Surround sound

Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene
Paintings
Overall the same thing

Sing song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension
Combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention

Meant to put you away with the pencil
Pistol, official
16 line a rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out all your flaws
Spin rah blah blah blah
You can say you saw


High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

And like the rock and rap
You know what I mean
People act like you know
Wow that's a new invention
That shit's brand new
We're constantly evolving
It is constantly changing

Sometimes...

There's a lot of change
Everybody's always up with labels
There ain't no label for this shit
They're always gonna try to put a label on it
Try to create something
So they can water it down


Sometimes I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood
Under the gun like a new disease


High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

You know what I mean, you can put a label on a lifestyle
