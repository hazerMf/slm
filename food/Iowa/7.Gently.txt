Gently my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure
A pleasure that'll take my mind off the reality of my life
My past life

Life as I know it now
And whatever may come
It slowly disappears to somewhere in the back of my mind
It will remain there 'til I wish to retrieve it

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Yeah

Yes, I will stay here for awhile
For I need a break
A break from the pressures of life
And everything that lays in the palms of life's hands

Ooh, life's hands
Yeah
Ooh

This mode is incredible
It's out of this world
Too bad I must always leave it
But that's life, yeah

That's life, yeah
That's life, yeah
That's life, yeah
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Oh, yes
