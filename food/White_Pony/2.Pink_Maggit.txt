I'll stick you a little
Enough to take your oxygen away
Then I'll set you on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
And I'm with you alone
I'm so into this whore
Afraid I might lose her
So forget about me
'Cause I'll stick you

Pushed back the square
Now that you've kneed her
In the throat
Well, there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of all
Transpose or stop your life
Is what you do

Pushed back the square
Now that you've kneed her
But you don't
So there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of all
So transpose or stop your life
Is what you do
Transpose or stop your life
What you do

Pushed back the square
Now that you've kneed her in the throat
Well, there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all

You are
You are

All you are
All you are
All you are
All you are is meat
