Blue star
Shine your light down
On everyone
'Cause I don't care
They're soothing me with their lung

Blue star
Shine your light down
Pierce for my face
To heal my veins

Right down on everyone
'Cause I don't care
You're soothing me with their lungs

It's more
It's more
Down
Shine your light
Shine your light down
It's more
It's more

On everyone
'Cause I don't care
You're soothing me with their lungs

Blue star
Shine your light
Shine your light
Shine your light down

Blue star
Down
Blue star
Shine down on everyone
'Cause I don't care
You're soothing me with their lungs

It's more
It's more
It's more
