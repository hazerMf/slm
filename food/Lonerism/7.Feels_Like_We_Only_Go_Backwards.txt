It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards, darling.

I know that you think, you sound
Silly when you call my name (my name)
But I hear it inside my head all day.
When I realize I'm just holding onto
The hope that maybe
Your feelings don't show...

It feels like I only go backwards, baby.
Every part of me says go ahead.
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards, darling.

The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no,
'Cause I decided long ago.
But that's the way it seems to go when trying
So hard to get to something real,
It feels...

It feels like I only go backwards, darling,
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards, darlin'.

Feels like I only go backwards, baby,
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards, darling.

Feels like I only go backwards, baby,
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards, darling.
