All I give are little clues
Maybe one day I'll get through
There is nothing I can do
I just keep on lying to you

I only need to say it's true
Only heart already knew
But there is nothing you can do
I just keep on lying to you,

Should my cover ever blow
Would you ever let it go
There is something you should know
But hell if I'd ever let it show

So here I am trying to be strong
It was noon and my shadow's long
I guess I'll go a day just as soon
As I get to the end of this song,
To the end of this song,
To the end of this song,
To the end of this song,
To the end of this song...

You won't be alone
Take all you can
Please understand
That it never really was love

All I give are little clues
Maybe one day I'll get through
There is nothing they could do
I just keep on lying to you
