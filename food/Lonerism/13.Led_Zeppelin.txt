Senses taking over, thought to set me free
I tried to get up but it was pouring down on me
Keeps on getting deeper, desperately to be
Said there's some guy interested in dragging it out of me
Oh, it's what I need, oh

Tell me you're in love to let it show

Just making magic, I was far enough to see it
Better than to get just what a stranger did to me
Is it because I love, is it because I don't, well, I just don't know
Keep on asking me, darling, let me see it, keep on asking
Is there any way to let it go?
