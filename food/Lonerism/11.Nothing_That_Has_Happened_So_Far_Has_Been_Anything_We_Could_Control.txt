Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
I am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you I don't know
Maybe I'm just reading into it a little deeper than I should
We would make it easy, we would take it slowly if only we could


Hey, what are you doing out here?
You're thinking about everything, aren't you?
I know it's crazy, just don't think of it like that
Nothing has to mean anything
Come on, come back inside

Melody, look at me
Unless you're trying to hurt me
Heavy blow, down I go
Now I just want to let go
Is it right? Is it wrong? I don't know
It's not the cause I'm fighting for anymore
But it sucks to keep on running
Eventually, there will be
A time for clearer thinking
For now, I weep, can't get to sleep
I try to hold a good feeling
I just get one, here it comes, there it goes
Now we just might lose the fight, yeah
But it's alright, it wasn't our decision

Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
I am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you what I know
Every man is happy until happiness is suddenly a goal
I'll just be here waiting 'til the doctor calls and then I'll let you know
