I may not be as honest as I ought to be
Now that, when the walls go up
I said it didn't worry me, but it hit me like an arrow
Babe, to know, I could just be paranoid
Won't quell the desire to know what was really goin' on
"Does it really fucking matter? Babe?"
Is all you can ask me
OK, fair play
Here we go

I've heard those words before
Are you sure it was nothing?
'Cause it made me feel like dying
Inside
Never thought I was insecure
But it's pure
Didn't notice
Until I was in love
For real
Am I really gonna cross the line?
Just to find what you're typing
If only I could read your mind
I'd be fine
I'd be normal
But now's my time
Gonna do it

And suddenly I'm the phoney one
The only one with a problem
True love is bringing it out of me
The worst in me
And I know now

Do you remember the time we were
The time we were by the ocean?
I didn't care if it was day or night
The world was right where I wanted

Girl I'm sorry
Babe I'm really, really sorry
