I meant to come back to put out bliss
But the style is crumbling, covered canned
It was sick and no you don't even know how
It comes and shifts then gets ruined by you fucking slobs

It's classical anyway

I can't help it, it makes me so sick over and over
It sits stiff bound with no heart, fine
Cause this is where the separation starts arising
I can see it coming over your cloud

It's classical anyway
How cool are you, I remember
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick

It's just a bad call
It's so funny how you think I'm so serious
Oh but that's not it, the thing is
I don't give enough jack to give a fuck
You're just plain boring and you bore me asleep

It's classical anyway
How cool are you, I remember
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick

Feel sickened, feel sickened
Feel sickened, feel sickened
Feel sickened, feel sickened
Feel sickened, I feel sick

And who the fuck are you anyway, you fuck?
It's making sick sense seeing how you're sticking out
Hardly hoping, about to please
Rise up off the fucking knees
Hop off the train for a second
And try to find your own fucking heart

It's classical anyway
How cool are you, I remember
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick

Feel sickened, feel sickened
Feel sickened, feel sickened
Feel sickened, feel sickened
Feel sickened, feel sickened

I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick
