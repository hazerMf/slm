Well, I'd like to mention a couple of joints on the Food album

Oh yeah, oh yeah, of course, my fault, I'm bugging up, yeah

One Beer, One Beer, man, uh, Hoe Cakes, in its own right, you know what I'm saying?
Uh, um, of course, Frenz, like, things like that, that are a little more challenging
You know what I mean? Uh, uh, um, um
Vomitspit is the last joint I put on there, kind of speed
I went on there after the leak, so, new, new joint

It's alright, cool, anything else particularly about you that people should know?
That kinda, you know

Nope, I'll let you know, the Villain ain't never gonna quit
TherÐµ's gonna be more and more coming out, so you know ready your headsets
And your um, and your speakers, make sure your monitors are in good working order
When you put the CD in it, don't bust it, and definitely

Cool

Definitely coming like, there ain't gon' be no shortage of um, of music
