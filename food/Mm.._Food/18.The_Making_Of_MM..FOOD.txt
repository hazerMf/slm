I quote right now, the thing that's coming with this is all about
Is about the MM.. Food record, so um you want to talk about
That record any like things that stand out to you in doing it
And I guess I've-I've-I've seen interviews that you're
Saying, it's sort of a, a turning point of this you know
Like you're gonna officially just become DOOM
And the MF would be no more, and
And like you know what, what's, what sparked that and everything like that?

Yeah, it's really just focusing, it is really what you know
He'll always be, I'm not doing my could be shaking
I'm still calling him, I'm doing my possession also
There is no way I can really do that
But I really mean it more like in a sense of just being personalized
You know what I'm saying? It's like doing the-the person that
You would ever really get close to know this cat
I mean, like, that's why I figure this Food album
Is like, in the most thought, and personal kind of opinion more than general, just battle lines
You know what I'm saying?
Kind of went into what he thinks about chicks more
What he thinks about, you know the game more
You know, it gets into more of the character, you know what I'm saying?
So, yeah, the Food album's a real, real personal album to me
