One, before you leave, lemme just say I wanna thank Rhymesayers
And Siddiq and the whole staff over there, like
This whole collabo that we doing, this-this, um
This kinda like, um, merge up kinda thing
Is, uh, really gon', gon', gon' really bring it to a head out here with this music sh-, music stuff like
Up the two companies, it's the way that they're set
You know what I'm saying, it's hip hop, like
Started 'em with the right intent, and we both going in the right direction
And this is just the crossroads, so
You know, there's gonna be a whole lotta good stuff coming out of that team up right there
What's this here?
Doc, Doc, here he comes again! What do we do?
