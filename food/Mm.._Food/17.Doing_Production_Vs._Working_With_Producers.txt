You definitely have like your own, like, um way of going about your production
That really, that really fits, you know, fits what you do
So is it harder sometimes when you work on other producers
And have them try to mold them into what their production is?

I would have to say, to me from an MC point of view
It's easier when, um, somebody else is providing them beats
And I can just listen to their beat and find them
Uh, uh, you know, this, this fine what it gives me
And-and going on that, when I'm the producer, it's like, all right
I may do the beat first, or I may have the verse first
And it kind of like sometimes it gets tricky
I'm like, "You got to separate the two," sometimes, you know what I mean?
Sometimes, it gets too integrated
But at the same time that enough integration of the two
Being they're both in one body kind of thing or one mind, it, it could
It could come up with interesting results
Like a lot of that is on this DOOM of this new shit
The Food shit, you know what I mean?
A lot of that melding of the producer and MC
On these songs that you wouldn't get
If I just got the beat from somebody, and did it

Right

You know what I mean?
So there all it is
Both of them are cool, different ways of getting good
